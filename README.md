# miscellaneous-projects

In this repo we post different codes and scripts prepared by the members for different activities such as tutorials, modelling coffee sessions, or in general to illustrate interesting results and methodologies to be shared with members of the lab and beyond!


**noise.r** presents some code developed by Marco to explore the results from the paper: ***Noise-induced effects in collective dynamics and inferring local interactions from data***, [Jhawar J, Guttal V. (2020) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 375: 20190381. http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0381](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0381)http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0381
